#Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
# Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
#0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
#Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it
i=0
n=1
while n<50:#prints till n is 50
    print(n)
    i,n = n,i+n #adds n with i every time until condition is met
